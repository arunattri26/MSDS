similarity-based methods we’ve done in Module 3. Can you suggest a way(s) to fix it? \n","\n","Ans- We can see the non-negative matrix facorization rmse is very different from from the simple baseline or similarity-based methods. It could be because we have a sparse matrix with lot of missing ratings for user-movie pairs and we fill them with 0. Since there are lot of 0 values it throws off the loss function in NMF. If we could use only non-zero values in NMF calculation and rmse then it could improve."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Github Link\n","\n","https://github.com/arunattri26/MSDS/blob/main/DTSA_5510_Unsupervised_Learning/HW4/Movie/MovieRatings.ipynb"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
